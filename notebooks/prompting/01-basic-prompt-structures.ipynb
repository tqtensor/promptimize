            "1. **Terrestrial Planets (Inner Planets)**\n",
            "   - **Mercury**: The closest planet to the Sun, it has a rocky surface and no atmosphere.\n",
            "   - **Venus**: Similar in size to Earth, it has a thick, toxic atmosphere and is the hottest planet due to a runaway greenhouse effect.\n",
            "   - **Earth**: The only known planet to support life, it has a diverse atmosphere and liquid water.\n",
            "   - **Mars**: Known as the \"Red Planet,\" it has a thin atmosphere, and there is evidence of past water flow.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Gas Giants (Outer Planets)**\n",
            "   - **Jupiter**: The largest planet in the solar system, it has a massive atmosphere composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, and it has many moons.\n",
            "   - **Saturn**: Famous for its extensive ring system, it is also a gas giant with a composition similar to Jupiter.\n",
            "   - **Uranus**: It has a blue-green color due to methane in its atmosphere, and it rotates on its side.\n",
            "   - **Neptune**: Known for its strong winds and storms, it has a deep blue color.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Dwarf Planets\n",
            "- **Pluto**: Once considered the ninth planet, it is now classified as a dwarf planet. It resides in the Kuiper Belt.\n",
            "- **Eris, Haumea, and Makemake**: Other examples of dwarf planets in our solar system.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Characteristics\n",
            "- **Orbit**: Planets orbit their star in elliptical paths.\n",
            "- **Rotation**: Planets rotate on their axes, which gives them day and night cycles.\n",
            "- **Atmosphere**: Some planets have thick atmospheres (like Venus), while others have thin or no atmospheres (like Mercury).\n",
            "- **Moons**: Many planets have moons, which are natural satellites that orbit them.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Formation\n",
            "- Planets form from the accretion of dust and gas in a protoplanetary disk around a young star. Over time, these materials coalesce to form larger bodies, eventually leading to the formation of planets.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Exploration\n",

            "- **Mass**: It has a mass 318 times that of Earth, which is about 1.9 x 10^27 kilograms.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Composition\n",
            "- **Atmosphere**: Jupiter's atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrogen (about 90%) and helium (about 10%), with trace amounts of other gases.\n",
            "- **Cloud Layers**: The planet has a complex system of cloud layers, with bands of different colors and compositions.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Notable Features\n",
            "- **Great Red Spot**: This is a giant storm larger than Earth that has been raging for at least 350 years.\n",
            "- **Magnetic Field**: Jupiter has the strongest magnetic field of any planet in the solar system, generated by its metallic hydrogen interior.\n",
            "- **Moons**: Jupiter has 79 known moons, including the largest moon in the solar system, Ganymede, which is even bigger than Mercury.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Exploration\n",
            "- **Voyager 1 and 2**: These spacecraft provided the first close-up images of Jupiter and its moons in the late 1970s.\n",
            "- **Galileo**: NASA's Galileo mission orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, providing detailed information about the planet and its moons.\n",
            "- **Juno**: NASA's Juno mission, launched in 2011, has been studying Jupiter's atmosphere, magnetic field, and interior since 2016.\n",

            "- **Comparison**: Jupiter's surface area is significantly larger, covering a much greater area.\n",
            "\n",

            "- **Jupiter**: Jupiter has a much lower average density than Earth because it is composed mostly of gases.\n",
            "- **Earth**: Earth has a much higher density due to its rocky composition.\n",
            "- **Comparison**: Despite its larger mass, Jupiter's density is only about one-fourth that of Earth.\n",

            "### Gravitational Force\n",
            "- **Jupiter**: Jupiter's gravity is about 24.79 m/s\u00b2, which is 2.528 times stronger than Earth's gravity (9.81 m/s\u00b2).\n",

            "A: The capital of France is Paris. Paris is not only the capital but also the largest city in France, known for its rich history, culture, and landmarks. It is situated in the northern central part of the country, along the Seine River. Paris is famous for its iconic architecture, such as the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Louvre Museum, which houses thousands of works of art, including the Mona Lisa. The city is also renowned for its contributions to art, fashion, cuisine, and philosophy. It serves as a major global center for business, diplomacy, and education.\n",

            "Q: What is its population?\n",
            "A: As of the most recent estimates, the population of Paris, the capital of France, is approximately 2.1 million people within the city limits. However, when considering the entire Paris metropolitan area, often referred to as the \"\u00cele-de-France\" region, the population is significantly larger, exceeding 12 million people. This makes the Paris metropolitan area one of the most populous in Europe. The city's population has been relatively stable over the past few decades, with growth primarily occurring in the surrounding suburbs.\n",

            "Q: What is the city's most famous landmark?\n",
            "A: The most famous landmark of Paris is the Eiffel Tower (La Tour Eiffel). Completed in 1889 for the Exposition Universelle (World's Fair), it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design but has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world. Standing at 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall, including its antenna, the Eiffel Tower is located on the Champ de Mars in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. It attracts millions of visitors each year, offering panoramic views of the city from its observation decks. The tower is not only a symbol of Paris but also a testament to the engineering prowess of the late 19th century.\n",
