        "\n",
        "Grasping various prompt structures is essential for effective AI communication. Single-turn prompts excel in quick, direct queries, while multi-turn prompts facilitate more nuanced, context-rich exchanges.

Secondary colors (green, orange, and purple) are formed by mixing two primary colors, while tertiary colors result from mixing a primary color with a secondary color.\n",

Factors such as lighting, surrounding colors, and the medium used can affect how a color is perceived. For example, a color may look different in natural light versus artificial light, or it may appear warmer or cooler when placed next to certain other colors.\n"
